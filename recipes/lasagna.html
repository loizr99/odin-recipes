        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Meat: </strong>This super meaty lasagna
                has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> lean ground beef.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion and garlic: </strong>An onion and two cloves
                of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tomato products: </strong>You'll need a can of crushed
                tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar: </strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
                sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices and seasonings: </strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored
                with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
                seeds, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lasagna noodles: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
                noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheeses: </strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
                this lasagna extra decadent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Egg: </strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
                out of the lasagna when you cut it.
            </li>
        </ul>
